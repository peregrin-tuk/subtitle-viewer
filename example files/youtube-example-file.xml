you got here.</text><text start="11.928" dur="1.335">So, let me try that. </text><text start="15.306" dur="1.585">We’re playing footsies! </text><text start="17.308" dur="1.544">We should have done this in 
outer space!</text><text start="19.227" dur="2.92">We could have both been 
sitting on, like, Neptune,</text><text start="22.23" dur="1.752">in a bubble.</text><text start="24.858" dur="2.043">Hey, what have you been
doing for fun?</text><text start="27.36" dur="2.961">I have not left home since 
March 8.</text><text start="30.447" dur="0.792">At all?</text><text start="31.364" dur="1.835">I went to an eye doctor’s 
appointment</text><text start="33.45" dur="3.336">because I could no longer fix
my eye infection</text><text start="37.579" dur="2.043">on telemedicine.</text><text start="39.873" dur="3.17">And then I went for 
a mammogram. </text><text start="43.293" dur="3.211">I asked what did you 
do for fun.</text><text start="47.088" dur="3.337">Eye doctors and mammograms
do not qualify.</text><text start="50.425" dur="2.21">I have never had a mammogram, 
myself</text><text start="52.635" dur="1.127">Okay, so for fun.</text><text start="53.762" dur="1.251">but it doesn’t sound fun. </text><text start="55.388" dur="2.461">You can do better than that.</text><text start="57.974" dur="2.336">No, it is, definitely, not.
Here’s what I did for fun:</text><text start="60.56" dur="1.919">I’ve had two girls here, 
the whole time,</text><text start="63.104" dur="1.585">who were living in Los Angeles, </text><text start="64.981" dur="1.46">who moved here during 
the pandemic</text><text start="66.733" dur="1.209">They’ve been fun.</text><text start="68.026" dur="2.627">We have movie nights, just the
two girls, Stedman, and I.</text><text start="70.779" dur="2.043">We do regular movie nights,</text><text start="72.989" dur="2.419">and I’ve seen all the movies I 
wished I’d seen and didn’t.</text><text start="76.409" dur="2.378">We watched every episode 
of “The Crown.”</text><text start="79.37" dur="3.671">We started a whole thing with 
Popsicles, so we now have—</text><text start="83.583" dur="1.126">That sounds fun.</text><text start="84.876" dur="2.377">—twenty-three different
flavors of Popsicles,</text><text start="87.42" dur="1.96">including pumpkin, 
and sweet potato.</text><text start="89.547" dur="2.836">And we have Friday-night
dance nights</text><text start="92.634" dur="1.668">We put puzzles together.</text><text start="94.636" dur="2.669">And I’ve read a lot. 
What have you done?</text><text start="97.597" dur="1.627">You know, we went—</text><text start="99.974" dur="2.419">—for example—Michelle and
I went bike riding yesterday,</text><text start="102.602" dur="1.502">which was fantastic,</text><text start="104.562" dur="1.585">because it was a beautiful day.</text><text start="106.648" dur="2.461">And game nights</text><text start="110.235" dur="2.711">—big!—although sometimes,
I get too competitive.</text><text start="113.78" dur="1.835">At least, that’s what 
Michelle says,</text><text start="115.782" dur="2.044">because she’s been losing.</text><text start="121.371" dur="2.335">Hello, President Barack Obama!</text><text start="123.915" dur="1.543">Hey you! How are you?</text><text start="125.583" dur="3.128">I’m so good! 
You’re in Washington, DC,</text><text start="128.837" dur="1.71">and I’m home, in Santa Barbara,</text><text start="130.672" dur="1.835">but—through the miracle 
of technology</text><text start="132.674" dur="2.127">—we get to be face to face in
the same room,</text><text start="135.009" dur="2.044">and we don’t even have 
to wear masks! </text><text start="137.262" dur="1.543">And we have a fire going, 
apparently!</text><text start="139.055" dur="1.668">And we have a fire going</text><text start="140.974" dur="1.376">—a real one, too!</text><text start="142.517" dur="3.462">I’m excited to talk to you 
about your extraordinary</text><text start="146.104" dur="1.752">—I mean, I don’t even have 
words for it,</text><text start="147.981" dur="3.336">—it’s a masterful rendering of
your presidency and life,</text><text start="151.442" dur="1.544">“A Promised Land.”</text><text start="153.403" dur="1.877">But first, I just want to 
ask you,</text><text start="155.446" dur="2.086">What was the one word that would</text><text start="157.615" dur="1.627">best describe how you felt
when it was</text><text start="159.325" dur="2.419">announced that Joe Biden 
and Kamala Harris will be</text><text start="161.828" dur="1.877">the next President and
Vice President</text><text start="163.788" dur="1.46">of the United States?</text><text start="165.29" dur="1.209">I was thrilled! </text><text start="166.624" dur="1.71">&amp;quot;Joe Biden&amp;quot;!</text><text start="168.501" dur="1.752">First of all, obviously, Joe</text><text start="170.587" dur="1.835">is somebody who</text><text start="172.589" dur="1.001">stood by me</text><text start="173.84" dur="2.711">on every major decision I 
had for eight years. </text><text start="176.718" dur="2.669">He&amp;#39;s become a brother 
-a genuinely good friend.</text><text start="179.512" dur="1.46">Kamala was one of my</text><text start="181.097" dur="3.253">earliest supporters when I 
first launched my presidency</text><text start="184.642" dur="2.253">So, I’m personally invested
in them.</text><text start="187.478" dur="2.753">And they have the character 
and experience, I think,</text><text start="190.69" dur="2.794">to do an outstanding job</text><text start="194.527" dur="2.961">in a very difficult time,</text><text start="197.614" dur="2.002">a very challenging time, in 
this country.</text><text start="200.033" dur="3.879">But, beyond the personal 
investment I have in them,</text><text start="204.245" dur="3.504">I think this gives us a
chance to</text><text start="208.291" dur="5.172">get back to the kind 
of competent,</text><text start="213.713" dur="4.588">caring government that we 
so badly need,</text><text start="218.635" dur="7.424">and that the world expects out
of the United States of America.</text><text start="226.351" dur="2.669">So, it’s not going to 
immediately solve every</text><text start="229.187" dur="2.252">every problem that we have</text><text start="231.731" dur="3.504">—because you have enormous
challenges, around COVID</text><text start="235.36" dur="2.919">and the economic after effects;</text><text start="238.529" dur="2.753">you’ve got long-standing issues,</text><text start="241.991" dur="2.628">like racial bias in the 
criminal justice system,</text><text start="245.245" dur="2.919">and rising inequality</text><text start="249.374" dur="2.627">—but without this change, I think,</text><text start="252.21" dur="3.42">things would have continued
to deteriorate,</text><text start="255.964" dur="4.671">and our democracy would have
been much more fragile.</text><text start="260.802" dur="1.96">And I’m confident</text><text start="263.012" dur="1.835">a new President 
and Vice President</text><text start="264.931" dur="1.376">are gonna help us 
right the ship.</text></transcript>
